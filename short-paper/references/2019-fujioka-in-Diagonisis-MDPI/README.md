## Notes
"
After retrospectively
collecting 528 images of 144 benign masses and 529 images of 216 malignant masses in the breasts,
synthesized images were generated using a DCGAN with 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 epochs. The
synthesized (n = 20) and original (n = 40) images were evaluated by two radiologists, who scored
them for overall quality, definition of anatomic structures, and visualization of the masses on a
five-point scale.

NETWORK!
"
The parameters for the generator and discriminator were the same as those reported
in the study by Radford et al. [6]: optimizer algorithm = Adam (lr = 0.0002, β1 = 0.5, β2 = 0.999,
eps = le −8 ). The image data were set to be input at a pixel size of 256 × 256 and output at a pixel size of
256 × 256

PREVIOUS WORK AND CLINICAL EVALUAITON
"
Additionally, Frid-Adar et al. reported that the accuracy of classifying
liver lesions was increased using synthetic images generated by a DCGAN from a limited dataset of
computed tomography images of 182 liver lesions (including cysts, metastases, and hemangiomas) as a
training set for the convolutional neural network [10]. Synthetic images of lung nodules on computed
tomography scans, chest infections on X-rays, and breast tissues on mammography using GANs have
also been reported [11–13]. However, reports of the use of GAN for medical images synthesis have not
demonstrated any associated clinical evaluations.

LIMITATIONS
* study was conducted at a single institution using three ultrasound systems from two companies
* not all recurrent lesions were diagnosed using cytological or histological diagnoses
* 256 × 256 pixel JPEG images. This image processing step might result in loss of information and influence the performance of the generating models
* the synthetic images were generated
using data from a mixture of benign and malignant masses. It may be possible to improve the reliability
of the synthetic images by collecting data from more cases, generating classified ultrasound images
representing different pathological cases, and comparing original date and patient information.
* we examined only ultrasound images of breast
masses; we have not fully verified whether images of normal breast tissues and non-mass-containing
breast lesions can be applied.

ABSTRACT = {Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) are newly developed tools for generating synthesized images. To determine the clinical utility of synthesized images, we generated breast ultrasound images and assessed their quality and clinical value. After retrospectively collecting 528 images of 144 benign masses and 529 images of 216 malignant masses in the breasts, synthesized images were generated using a DCGAN with 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 epochs. The synthesized (n = 20) and original (n = 40) images were evaluated by two radiologists, who scored them for overall quality, definition of anatomic structures, and visualization of the masses on a five-point scale. They also scored the possibility of images being original. Although there was no significant difference between the images synthesized with 1000 and 500 epochs, the latter were evaluated as being of higher quality than all other images. Moreover, 2.5%, 0%, 12.5%, 37.5%, and 22.5% of the images synthesized with 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 epochs, respectively, and 14% of the original images were indistinguishable from one another. Interobserver agreement was very good (|r| = 0.708&ndash;0.825, p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, DCGAN can generate high-quality and realistic synthesized breast ultrasound images that are indistinguishable from the original images.},
